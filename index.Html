       <p><h2 style="font-size: 200%; color: brown;">overview:</h2></p><br/><br/>
       <p style="color: blanchedalmond;" >The interior of the Matrouh Governorate is part of Egypt's Western Desert, including the Siwa Oasis, in antiquity known for its shrine to Amun.<br/><br/> In the center of the Governorate is the Qattara Depression, descending to 133 metres below sea level.<br/><br/>

        Marsa Matrouh is the ancient Koinē Greek: Παραιτόνιον Paraitónion, Latin Paraetonium. It was the westernmost city of the Ptolemaic <br/><br/> Kingdom in the Hellenistic period. The city of Apis, some 18 km to the west of Paraetonium, marked the boundary to Libycus nome, ,<br/><br/> and the Halfaya Pass (at Sallum) marked the boundary to Marmarica proper.
        
        Matrouh Governorate contains many <br/><br/>historical sites related to World War II. The latter include el Alamein, which comprises cemeteries of fallen soldiers <br/><br/>from Axis and Allied forces.An estimated 16 million mines,[6] planted by the Europeans during the world wars and called <br/><br/>"devil's gardens", still hinder development of most of the governorate, and are constantly being removed.
        
        The province has been<br/><br/>described as "religiously conservative"</p><br/><br/>
        <p><h2 style="font-size: 200%;color: brown;">the history of matrouh:</h2></p><br/><br/>
        <p style="color: blanchedalmond;">Mersa Matruh started as a small fishing town during Ancient Egyptian times and the reign of Alexander The Great and was named Amunia.<br/><br/> There are ruins of a temple for Ramesses II (1200 BC). The city became known as Paraitonion in the Ptolemaic era.<br/><br/> Ovid wrote that its goddess is Isis.[2] After Egypt came under Roman rule, the town became an important harbor for trade and shipping goods <br/><br/>and crops to Rome.<br/><br/>

            After the Arabic conquest, the city's name changed to Al-Baretun. The city also bore other names from at least the beginning of<br/><br/> 20th century – Berek Marsa, Port Mhaddra (Mithr) and Port Bardiah.[3]
            
            During World War II, the British Army's Baggush Box was located <br/><br/> to the east. Starting with the completion of an extension from the previous railhead at Fuka in February 1936,[4] Mersa Matruh was the terminus<br/><br/> for a single-track railway, which passed through El Alamein.<br/><br/> Mersa Matruh served as a vital British military base during World War II and was a major objective of Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps,<br/><br/> which captured it during the Battle of Mersa Matruh .</p>
